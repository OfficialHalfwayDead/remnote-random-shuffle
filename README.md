# Random Shuffle Rems

Allows you to shuffle children of a Rem in a random order, just like the base app supports for alphabetical order.

## Usage

When on a Rem, type `/sh` or the full command name `/Shuffle Children or Selection` to random sort all the children of the current Rem.

You can also multiselect Rems and then use the same command. It will not shuffle the children when selecting multiple items.
